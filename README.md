This repository contains the scripts used to obtain the data in the paper "A Survey of Open Source Software Repositories in the US Department of Energy's National Laboratories" in Computing in Science &amp; Engineering (2024).

This work was exploratory in nature, and at first we did not expect a peer-reviewed publication would come of this curriousity-driven research. Consequently, the scripts here are "research-ware" and are decidely not polished. We publish them for the sake of transparency and reproducablity.

We are in the planning process of writing a more professional framework (e.g., with documentation, clear APIs, etc.) to make this work more generalizable to more platforms (e.g., GitLab, PyPi, etc.) and to increase reproducability going forward. Please contact sam@cs.uoregon.edu with questions.
